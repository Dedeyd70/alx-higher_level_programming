# __Python - Exceptions__

### Exceptions are a way to handle errors or unexpected situations that may occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, python raises an exception which interrupts the normal flow of the program and jumps to an exeception handling block. The basic idea behind exceptions is to provide a mechanism for the program to gracefully handle errors without crashing. This allows the program to continue executing even if some parts encounter problems, giving the developer the opportunity to respond to error appropriately.
