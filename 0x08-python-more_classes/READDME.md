# Python - More Classes and Objects

### Python more classes is a broad topic that refers to the advanced concepts and techniques related to object-oriented programming(OOP) in python. This includes topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsultaion, abstract classes and interfaces. In OOP, classes are used to define objects and their properties(attributes) and behaviours(methods) and Python provides a rich set of tools to work with classes and objects. Developers can write more efficient, scalable and reusable codes when these concepts are fully understood.
